### About Me
I am a passionate technology and VLSI enthusiast with experience in embedded systems and IoT. I've served as a coordinator and volunteer in various workshops conducted in the college and have hands-on experience with platforms like Arduino, ESP32, ESP8266, STM32, 8051, and LoRaWAN. I enjoy exploring new domains and technologies, and I thrive on interacting with people.

### Initiative
My inspiration to create this documentation website came from a site built by friends for a Gen AI Bootcamp using Docusaurus. I was part of the KHACKS community at the time, and their project sparked my passion for building one of my own.
